This is a spacer for the OMAX M615INV Portable Inverted Microscope 40x-400x. ([Amazon], [MicroscopeNet])

The spacer allows tissue flasks and petri dishes to fit on the stage by increasing the distance between the light condensor and the sample stage. You can adjust the height using the OpenSCAD or the Makerbot customizer. The original height is 19mm.
